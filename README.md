# Campaign Guide

We're so glad you're considering running for office! This guide aims to give you a quick overview of what you need to get done asap to lay the groundwork for your digital presence.

## Basic Steps

1. **The most important step:** own your name.
* Buy web domains with your name. Ragtag's go-to for searching for domain names is Namecheap.com. Put your name in the big search box, and see what comes up. If you can get _yourname_.com, _yourname_.org, or _yournameforyouroffice_.com or .org for under about $15 you should just do it. 
* If it is more than about $15 it might be worth checking for a better deal on other domain name registration sites, like www.domains.google or www.gandi.net. 
* Why is this so important? Two reasons. One, you want your potential supporters to be able to find information about you in the easiest way possible. Owning _yourname_.com is the best way to do that. The second reason is so that your opponent doesn't buy your domain. If your opponent buys _yourname_.com and puts smear ads on it, there's nothing you can really do about it. So prevention is key here.
2. Set up a campaign email address
* Set up an email address for your work with your campaign. It is very important for you to keep your personal emails separate from your campaign emails. Same goes for google docs accounts.
* You can get an email address for free from Gmail (http://gmail.com) or Outlook (https://outlook.live.com/owa/) if you like, by making an email account called _yournameforoffice_@gmail.com.
* An even better approach is to pay for professional email from Google or Microsoft. Both are accessible entirely online, and cost about $5 per email address per month. BONUS if you use Google's G Suite, you get all the Google apps you know and love, but with more centralized access control, so you know YOU are the one who owns ALL the google docs.
* Remember: Don't mix personal and campaign accounts. Just don't. 
3. Get a basic website going. Squarespace is going to be easiest, and it'll be even easier if you're using them for your domain. If you're already using NGP to manage your volunteers, the NGP website builder will be the cheapest option.
4. Get a twitter account with your name in it. Point the website at your new domain with your name in it.
5. Set up a Facebook page for your campaign. Point it at your website.
6. Set up a mailing list with Mailchimp. Link to the sign-up form on your website.
