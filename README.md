# Campaign Guide

Congratulations! You've decided to run for office. This is a huge step, and we're thrilled that you want to get involved in civic discourse at such a high level. This guide aims to help provide digital strategy tips and tools for running a campaign.

## Basic Steps

1. Get a domain name with your name in it. We recommend squarespace.com, hover.com or gandi.com as registrars. (~$12/year. If you can afford variations, buy those as well)
2. Get a basic website going. Squarespace is going to be easiest, and it'll be even easier if you're using them for your domain.
3. Get a twitter account with your name in it. Point the website at your new domain with your name in it.
4. Set up a Facebook page for your campaign. Point it at your website.
5. Set up a mailing list with Mailchimp. Link to the sign-up form on your website.
